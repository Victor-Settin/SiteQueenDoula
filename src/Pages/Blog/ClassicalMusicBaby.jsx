          ðŸŽ» Why Is My Baby Smarter Than Me? (Blame Classical Music)
        </h1>
        <p className="blog-author">By Purple Turtle Doula & Nanny Services</p>

        <p>So, youâ€™ve got a newborn in one arm and a cup of cold coffee in the other, and suddenly youâ€™re blasting Beethoven in the background because someone on the internet said it makes your baby smarter. But is that true?</p>
        <p>Wellâ€¦ sort of. Letâ€™s break it down, giggles included.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>ðŸŽ¼ Classical Music = Baby Brain Vitamins?</h2>
        <p>Okay, so classical music doesnâ€™t literally make your baby a genius overnight (sorry, Ivy League). But studies suggest it can help your babyâ€™s brain develop in some really cool ways, like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Better memory</li>
          <li>Improved language skills</li>
          <li>Emotional regulation</li>
          <li>More restful sleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why? Because classical music is full of patterns, predictable rhythms, and complex tones that stimulate your babyâ€™s auditory and cognitive development without overwhelming them.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>ðŸŒ™ 1. Clair de Lune â€“ Debussy</h2>
        <p>Soft, dreamy, and perfect for bedtime. Calms the nervous system and promotes sleepy vibes.</p>

        <h2>ðŸ©° 2. GymnopÃ©die No.1 â€“ Erik Satie</h2>
        <p>Minimal, slow, and ideal for naptime or quiet feeds. Helps with focus and self-soothing.</p>

        <h2>ðŸŒŒ 3. Moonlight Sonata â€“ Beethoven</h2>
        <p>Moody and emotional. Boosts auditory discrimination and language processing.</p>

        <h2>ðŸŽ¹ 4. Prelude in C Major â€“ Bach</h2>
        <p>Orderly and structured. Supports logic, memory, and sequencing.</p>

        <h2>ðŸŒ¸ 5. Waltz of the Flowers â€“ Tchaikovsky</h2>
        <p>Upbeat and expressive. Encourages sensorimotor development and joy.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>ðŸŽ§ Is Classical Music Better Than Other Music?</h2>
        <p>It depends! Calm rhythms, predictable melodies, moderate volume â€” and music you enjoy too â€” are the most important factors.</p>

        <hr />
        <h2>ðŸ’œ Final Notes</h2>
        <p>Classical music is a beautiful, screen-free way to support your babyâ€™s development â€” and maybe give your own brain a break, too.</p>
        <p>Whether youâ€™re rocking out to Bach or bouncing to Tchaikovsky, youâ€™re building your babyâ€™s brain and your bond together.</p>
