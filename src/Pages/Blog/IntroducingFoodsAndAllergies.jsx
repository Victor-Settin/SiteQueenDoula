        <h1 className="blog-title">🍽️ Introducing Foods & Preventing Allergies in Babies: What Parents Need to Know</h1>
        <p className="blog-author">By Purple Turtle Doula & Nanny Services</p>

        <p>Starting solids is an exciting (and slightly nerve-wracking) milestone for many parents. It’s not just about what to serve — it’s also about how and when to safely introduce new foods, especially the ones that commonly cause allergies.</p>

        <h2>🍼 When Can I Start Feeding My Baby Solids?</h2>
        <p>Most babies are ready to start solids around 6 months, but some may show signs a little earlier (closer to 4 months). Always talk to your pediatrician before beginning.</p>
        <p><strong>Signs baby might be ready:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can sit up with little or no support</li>
          <li>Has good head and neck control</li>
          <li>Shows interest in what you’re eating</li>
          <li>Can move food to the back of the mouth and swallow</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🥄 How to Introduce New Foods</h2>
        <p>Start slow and keep it simple. You can introduce one new food every 3–5 days to monitor for any signs of reaction.</p>
        <p><strong>Good first foods:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Puréed vegetables (carrots, sweet potatoes, peas)</li>
          <li>Mashed fruits (banana, avocado, pear)</li>
          <li>Baby cereal (iron-fortified oats or rice)</li>
          <li>Well-cooked lentils or beans (smooth texture)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>⚠ What About Allergy-Prone Foods?</h2>
        <p>Introducing allergy-prone foods early (around 4–6 months, once your baby has tolerated a few basic solids) may actually help reduce the risk of developing food allergies, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
        <p><strong>Top 9 allergy-prone foods to introduce:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Peanut</li>
          <li>Egg</li>
          <li>Cow’s milk (in baked or processed form)</li>
          <li>Soy</li>
          <li>Wheat</li>
          <li>Tree nuts</li>
          <li>Shellfish</li>
          <li>Fish</li>
          <li>Sesame</li>
        </ul>

        <p>📝 Start with tiny amounts, like a teaspoon of peanut butter thinned with water or breastmilk, and wait 2–3 days before introducing the next allergen.</p>

        <h2>🧪 How Can I Make It Easier?</h2>
        <p>If you’re nervous about introducing allergens or want a structured way to do it, there are safe, pediatrician-approved options on the market.</p>

        <h2>💡 Spotlight: Ready. Set. Food!</h2>
        <p>A well-known, science-backed supplement that helps gradually introduce allergens like peanut, egg, and milk in a powder form you mix into breastmilk, formula, or baby food.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>✅ Easy to use daily</li>
          <li>✅ Clinically studied and pediatrician recommended</li>
          <li>✅ Ideal for families who want an extra layer of support with food introduction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: It’s a great option for parents who can afford it and want a guided approach — but it’s not required for allergy prevention. You can still do this naturally with whole foods!</p>

        <h2>🩺 When to Be Cautious:</h2>
        <p>Contact your pediatrician before introducing allergenic foods if your baby:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Has moderate to severe eczema</li>
          <li>Has a diagnosed food allergy</li>
          <li>Has a sibling with a history of food allergies</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="doula-tip"><strong>❤ Doula Tip:</strong> Introducing solids is not just about nutrition — it’s about connection, discovery, and building trust. Take it slow, follow your baby’s cues, and don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p>
